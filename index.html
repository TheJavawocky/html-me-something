         <article>I play Burn in Modern. The deck is designed to be as efficient and consistant as possible, running many redundant cards that achieve the same goal; reducing the opponent to 0 life.</article>
         <article>I play Death & Taxes in Legacy. The deck is designed to tax the opponent on their mana to prevent them from playing cards while my cheaper creatures attack to reduce their health to 0.</article>
         <article>I play Affinity in Pauper. The deck focuses on Artifacts, using cards with the "Affinity for Arifacts" effect to play cheap & efficient creatures. It also has a built in combo-kill with Atog and Fling. </article>
